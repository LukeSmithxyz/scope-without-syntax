Dear Luke,
these are some reflections on your interesting and highly original work in progress on game theory and scope. The French cognitive anthropologist Dan Sperber has analyzed conversation and relevance in terms of game theory.

Is it really a pragmatic issue, or rather an issue of the interfaces between syntax, SM and IC?

Is “cost” additional computation? Or is it temporary failure to understand?

The battle of the sexes has two Nash equilibria. How do you want to deal with these? It can have one only, if you introduce probabilities (mixed strategies). Can ambiguity be approached by means of probabilities (the default/preferred more probable interpretation versus the marked, less probable interpretation)?

What about scalar implicatures? Can you treat them game-theoretically?

German is not really a scrambling language (unlike Persian). The scrambling is limited to the Mittelfeld (middle field). Alessandra Tomaselli has interesting papers on this.

An interesting case of an ambiguous word in English is “unlockable” (ask Dave Medeiros for details). It can mean impossible to lock or possible to unlock. A deviation from the overwhelming generality that negation is always the top morpheme, with widest scope. See work by Anna Maria di Sciullo. Inedible means impossible to eat, unpublishable means impossible to publish etc. We do not have something like *ediimble hypothetically meaning possible not to eat, and similar. This appears to be a linguistically universal morpho-lexical property.

You mention, just mention, negative polarity items. Do you plan to develop this?

On page 12, top, you say: “Such a framework would be able to maintain the statement that human language, at its syntactic core, should be independent of linear order, as the linear order effects are part of the pragmatic traits of language use and discourse.”
Well, word order is not in the syntactic core, fine, but it’s not pragmatic, it’s an issue of the interface with SM.

There is an interesting issue with “only”. Presuppositional or existential? It does not instantiate the conservativity/intersectivity universal (see work by Higginbotham and May, I sent you one piece). Chierchia has argued that it’s not a quantifier, so no problem that it’s not intersective, while Elena Herburger, in her essay “What Counts”, says it is, having its restriction on non-focused material, as shown by adjectivization and adverbials “only young angels have wings” you focus on old angels, “only rarely does he come”, you focus on events of his not-coming. Have a look at that. Maybe your approach can say something new.

More on all this when we meet
Massimo

I will manually insert a 100% grade into D2L for each. Very good questions that I will forward to the spaekers. I hope you will have no electronic problems in the future. As to your questions about my presentation, I will get back to you soon about them
