# Scope Without Syntax: A Game Theoretic Approach -- Qualifying Paper

This is a public gir repository for my second qualifying paper.

## Topic

I argue that the different availabilities of scope interpretations across languages and constructions falls out from several pragmatic assumptions, and that formal syntax is not necessary as a tool to explain this data.

 I use Game Theory as a tool to explain the interactions between these pragmatic effects.
